## Image Captioning
In this deep learning  project I'am making a model composed from a covolutional neural network and a Recurrent neural network so we can predict a convenient caption for the image , I am using Flicker [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ming666/flicker8k-dataset) and Pytorch framework
