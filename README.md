## Image Captioning
In this deep learning  project I'am making a model composed from a covolutional neural network and a Recurrent neural network so we can predict a convenient caption for the image , I am using Flicker [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ming666/flicker8k-dataset) and Pytorch framework

[## Flight delays ](https://github.com/bouhamedayman/Flight_delays)
In This project I applied Catboost to predict whether a flight is going to delay more than 15 min I am using [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-fall-2018/data) from Kagggle
