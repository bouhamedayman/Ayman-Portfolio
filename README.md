## Image Captioning
In this deep learning  [project](https://github.com/bouhamedayman/Image-Captions) I'am making a model composed from a covolutional neural network and a Recurrent neural network so we can predict a convenient caption for the image , I am using Flicker [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ming666/flicker8k-dataset) and Pytorch framework

## Flight delays 
In This [project](https://github.com/bouhamedayman/Flight_delays) I applied Catboost to predict whether a flight is going to delay more than 15 min I am using [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-fall-2018/data) from Kagggle

## COVID-19 Tweeter sentiment analysis
In this [project](https://github.com/bouhamedayman/covid19_sentiment_analysis) I worked on predicting the sentiments of Tweeter users on covid-19 disaster using sentiment NLP techniques I worked on data preprocessing and made the modeling using BERT
